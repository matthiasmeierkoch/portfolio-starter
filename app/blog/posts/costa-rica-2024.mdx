With my suitcase, backpack, and surfboard bag, I took a short train ride to Zurich Airport. At the gate, I was still working on last-minute tasks, feeling a mix of anticipation and disbelief about the trip ahead.

The 12-hour flight passed with a mix of movies and conversations with other solo travelers. Eventually, we landed in San José, where I would spend the night before continuing to Mal País the next morning.

Early in the morning, I joined a shared bus transfer, picking up other travelers from different spots around San José. The city gradually gave way to open landscapes as we made our way to the coast.

At the ferry terminal, we switched to the boat for the next part of the journey. During the crossing, I met another Swiss traveler, and our conversation made the time pass quickly. On the other side, another bus was waiting to take us toward Mal País and Santa Teresa.

After about seven hours of travel, I arrived at La Point Surf Camp. I was given a room to myself and, after settling in, walked down to the beach to see the sunset and meet some of the other people staying at the camp.

After my first night at the surf camp, I was still feeling the effects of jet lag and found it hard to fully switch off from work. Letting go of routine wasn’t as easy as I had hoped.

Later in the day, I joined a yoga session while it rained outside, which turned out to be exactly what I needed—quiet, calming, and a good way to reset. I also started meeting new people, mostly from the UK, who were easy to get along with and made settling in feel more natural.

Despite the initial adjustment, I was slowly getting into the rhythm of being here and enjoying the break.

Mondays at the surf camp meant change—many people from the previous week were leaving, while new arrivals were settling in. It gave the place a different energy, a mix of goodbyes and fresh introductions.

I moved from my private room into a shared space with some of the people I’d be surfing with for the week. It felt like a natural transition, making it easier to connect with the group.

While the new arrivals were getting settled, I took the opportunity to head out for a surf session. The waves were a good way to reset and ease into the week ahead.

## Tuesday, 19. Nov, 2024 - Thursday 21. Nov, 2024
The next few days were filled with surfing at some amazing spots—Playa Carmen, Playa Hermosa, and Cabuya. Each beach had its own character and offered something unique to the experience.

On my first day at Playa Carmen, I quickly realized how much work it would take to get back into surfing shape. I had to really build up my strength and endurance, and, to be honest, the waves humbled me a bit. It was a reminder of how challenging the sport can be, but also how rewarding.

Playa Hermosa, on the other hand, was breathtaking. One of the most beautiful beaches I’d ever seen, with crystal-clear water and perfect waves that made for an incredibly fun session.

Then there was Cabuya—a standout spot with a right-hand point break over reef. The waves were great, and there was a guy selling fresh coconuts right by the beach, offering the perfect post-surf hydration. It made the whole experience feel even more laid-back and enjoyable.
