## Day 1
Taking the train from Zürich Hauptbahnhof towards Bern, we switched the train towards Visp, going through the Lötschberg-Basistunnel, which is second longest tunnel in Switzerland (34,577 km). In Visp we switched trains for the last time and one hour later we arrived in the picturesque town of Zermatt.
In the evening we had dinner and discussed the plans and possible routes for the next days.

## Day 2
7:00 AM we headed for breakfast and then made our way to the gondola lift station. We took the gondola to "Klein Mattherhorn" from where we started our first tour towards Breithorn (4,160 m). It's been very busy but a great way to get used to the altitute. Afterwards we were able to ski all the way down towards Zermatt. 

## Day 3
After a slighty later breakfast we again made our way to "Klein Mattherhorn" with the Gondola, but this time we made our way towards "Schwarztor" from where we descended over the "Schwärzegletscher" down onto the "Gornergletscher" from there we made about 450m of elevation towards the beautiful Monte Rosa Hut.
After arriving, we spent some time relaxing, enjoying the view and playing cards. In the evening we got a great 4 course menu and then headed to bed early.

## Day 4
6:00 AM: After a night of very little sleep due to the high altitute and some people snoring in our room, we had breakfast and started walking at 7:00 AM. We walked towards "Saaserlücke" where we first had to take our skis off, climb up on to the mountain ride and then had to repell down the other side. 
From there we walked towards Cima di Jazzi, but kept a lower line and then decided to turn towards Stockhorn (3532m) from where we began our last descent back towards Zermatt.
We had a very fortunate timing, as we were getting back to Zermatt we were able to catch the next train that brought us back home.
