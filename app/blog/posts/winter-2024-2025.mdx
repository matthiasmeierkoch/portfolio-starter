The days are getting shorter, the air is getting colder, and the familiar seasonal depression might just be starting to knock on the door.
This is winter in Switzerland, and this winter season was a special one to me, here's why: 

## St. Anton, December 2024
On a Thursday, late afternoon, we took the direct train from Zurich to St. Anton. 2.5 hours and a few meetings later, we arrived in the austian alps, St. Anton to be more percise.

Spent 3 days there, enjoying the Skiing, the Hotel Spa, and some great food.

## Arosa, January 2024
Every year, my team does a Skitrip, this year we were in Arosa, a remote and beautiful small town in the heart of the Swiss Alps.
Having signed up for the backcountry skiing, we did the ski safari from Arosa to Lenzerheide and back.
High and low light: I had some squirrels climbing up on me, and I triggered a small avalanche.

## Lauenen bei Gstaad, March 2025
Went skiing, skitouring and enjoying the early spring weather in the area of Gstaad.
The snow was almost gone on southern facing slopes, but the nothern facing slopes were great!

## Engelberg (freeride days), March 2025
Did the "Scared" tour at the Engelberg freeride days 2025. We skied "Steinberg" and "Sulz" and then did some repelling exercises. After the exercises we felt ready to Ski the bottleneck couloir, a very steep couloir that eventually ends above a small, frozen waterfall, over which we repelled down.
