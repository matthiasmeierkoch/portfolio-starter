As a User Experience and Interface Designer at internezzo, I worked on a variety of impactful web projects. My role also extended to actively shaping the brand "internezzo" and it's communication tools.

Below are two highlights that showcase my approach to delivering user-centric and effective solutions:

## Animal Protection Zürich - Client Pitch (2019)

Tasked with a website redesign pitch for [Animal Protection Zürich](https://www.zuerchertierschutz.ch/en/), I focused on creating an emotionally resonant and highly useful user experience. My process involved in-depth research beyond the initial brief, including analyzing social media, Google Reviews, and conducting a user interview with someone who had recently adopted a pet from the shelter. This allowed me to identify key user pain points and opportunities.

Key contributions and impact:

* User-Centric Design: The proposed design prioritized an emotional connection, aiming to make users feel welcome and supported. The homepage was envisioned as a space for transparent communication and a glimpse into the organization's work.

* Innovative "Animalfinder" Feature: A core element was the "Animalfinder", a tool designed to help potential adopters find a suitable pet based on their lifestyle, environment, budget, and available time.

* Interactive Donation Form: To encourage support, I designed an interactive donation form that visually communicated the impact of contributions through engaging illustrations.

Structured Information Architecture: I revamped the navigation for the extensive 200+ page website, categorizing services into three clear topics: Animal Protection, Having Pets, and Animal Shelter. This significantly improved usability and allowed for strategic promotion of projects and donation opportunities.

The thoughtful research and innovative design solutions were key factors in internezzo successfully winning this competitive pitch.

## Family Portal Bern - Client Pitch (2020)

When internezzo pitched for the redesign of the Family Portal Bern, I took a data-driven approach to quickly demonstrate value. Given limited time and resources, I leveraged the client's Google Analytics data to inform the design strategy.

**Key contributions and impact:**

* Data-Informed "Quick Access List": Analysis of user behavior allowed for the creation of a "quick access list" featuring the 11 most frequently visited topics. This significantly streamlined navigation and saved users valuable time.

* Enhanced Content Highlighting: The design incorporated dedicated sections for news teasers and events, enabling the Family Portal Bern team to effectively promote important information and activities.

* This strategic, data-backed design preview was instrumental in securing the project. The proposed design, with minor refinements, was successfully implemented and is now live on the [Family Portal Bern website](https://www.fambe.sites.be.ch/).

These projects exemplify my commitment to combining thorough research, user empathy, and strategic design to create digital experiences that not only meet client goals but also resonate deeply with their target audiences.
